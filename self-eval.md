# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? It was enjoyable to work through some problems by looking up new answers without guidance, didn't quite get them all figured out. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? Been pretty great, taking breaks when frustrated and asking for help when necessary. Pretty confident for the final pair session evaulation tomorrow. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? Always rely on classmates for help, don't be afraid to ask questions, take breaks when necessary.
